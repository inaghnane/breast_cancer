# 🩺 Breast Cancer Diagnosis App using Machine Learning
This web application allows medical professionals to predict the diagnosis of breast tumors (benign or malignant) based on clinical measurements from a biopsy.

🚀 Features
🧠 Powered by a trained Machine Learning model (Python, scikit-learn)

📤 Import patient data via Excel file

📥 Downloadable template for required clinical features

📊 Prediction results displayed directly on the interface

💻 Frontend built with React.js

🌐 Communication between React frontend (port 3000) and Flask backend (port 5000)

📝 How It Works
The user downloads the Excel template.

A doctor fills in the required clinical measurements (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness, etc.).

The file is uploaded via the interface.

The system processes the file and uses a machine learning model to predict whether each tumor is benign or malignant.

Results are displayed in real-time on the web page.
